# Hospital Appointment Management System

This project is a **comprehensive Hospital Appointment Management System** built using **ASP.NET Core MVC with C# (.NET 8)**. It is designed to streamline the appointment scheduling process while ensuring robust user role authentication and access control.

## Key Features:
- **Role-based Authentication & Authorization**: The system securely manages user roles, allowing **Admins** to schedule appointments by selecting both the patient and the doctor. **Doctors** can review and approve pending appointments, while **patients** have the ability to view their scheduled appointments. Meticulous authorization ensures data security and prevents unauthorized access.
  
- **Intuitive Calendar Interface**: A dynamic, user-friendly calendar is integrated via **FullCalendar.io**, offering seamless navigation across month, week, and day views. The calendar provides full **CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)** functionality, with data stored in **Microsoft SQL Server** for reliability and performance.

- **Email Notifications**: Email notifications are sent to both doctors and patients upon appointment creation, keeping everyone updated in real time. This is powered by **MailKit**, ensuring reliable and secure communication.

## Technology Stack:
- **ASP.NET Core MVC** for powerful, scalable web application development.
- **Entity Framework Core** for seamless interaction with **MS SQL Server**.
- **FullCalendar.io** for a visually appealing and fully functional calendar view.
- **MailKit** for integrated email notifications.
- **GitHub** for version control and collaboration.
- **Microsoft Azure** for potential cloud deployment.
- Frontend technologies: **HTML, CSS, JavaScript**, and **Bootstrap** for responsive and modern UI/UX.
- **C# (OOP)** for backend logic and application structure.

This project was initially developed as part of a course by **Bhrugen Patel**, and I have since expanded and customized it further. His guidance was instrumental in shaping this project.
